  This service lets the caller enable or disable an AP from this point onward.

  an AP is being disabled, then the state of the disabled AP is implementation
  dependent. If an AP is enabled, then the implementation must guarantee that a
  complete initialization sequence is performed on the AP, so the AP is in a state
  that is compatible with an MP operating system. This service may not be supported
